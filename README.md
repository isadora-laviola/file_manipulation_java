Make a program to read the path of a .csv file
containing the data of items sold. Each item has a
name, unit price and quantity, separated by a comma. You
should generate a new file called "summary.csv", located
in a subfolder called "out" from the original folder of the
source file, containing only the name and total value for
that item (unit price multiplied by quantity).
